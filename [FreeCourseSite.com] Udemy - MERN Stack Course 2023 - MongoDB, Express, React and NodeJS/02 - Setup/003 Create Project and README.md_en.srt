00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,690
Beautiful.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,790
And once we're familiar with the final application, let's start working on our own project.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,900
And the first task might look somewhat trivial where we all need to set up an empty folder.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,200
So basically come up with the name of your application and name the folder our way, and they will set

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,090
up a read me the first.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,460
In my case, I'm going to do that unless of course, you can set it up anywhere you like, and I'm just

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,550
going to go with the same name.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,430
I'm going to go with a job.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:37,770
For one, I'm going to open up my visual studio code, my text editor, and like I said, first file

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,210
that I want to set up here is actually read me.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,850
So I'm going to go with read me and not let me go all uppercase.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,250
Read me and markdown.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,860
And the idea behind this file is falling.

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,750
Before each video, I will share all the steps I'm going to take.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,120
So that way, if you want to complete the task on your own, it's definitely an option.

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,290
I use that approach in one of the projects in my adult course.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,840
And students seem to really like it.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,520
One quick side note, though, if there's a discrepancy between what you see in the video and the content

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,300
in your read me, please follow your lead me content since I probably fixed it after I recorded the

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,060
video in order to get all the steps.

21
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,460
Navigate to Final Project.

22
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,980
Look for me in the source and what you can do is take this whole thing.

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,770
Copy and paste it over here.

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,880
And once you have the project, we have a read in place.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,030
Now we can proceed to the next step.
