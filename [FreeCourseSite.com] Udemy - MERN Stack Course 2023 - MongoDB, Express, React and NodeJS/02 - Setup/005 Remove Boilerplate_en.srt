1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,900
And once her boilerplate application is running on local three thousand next, I want to do some spring

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,180
cleaning more in the sauce.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,120
I want you to remove abscesses.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:23,520
App that's dress logo, 3G port, where vitals as well as set up test and then we need to fix, address

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,580
as well as index Jess because there are some imports and we're relying on those files.

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,369
So let's just start by removing some stuff.

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,510
I'm going to go with the lead.

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,990
So we're going to remove this one abscess.

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,170
And, you know, I think I can just combine them.

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,660
So and I also want to go with these two.

11
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,880
Let's just remove all of them here.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,920
And then, like I said, we want to fix the imports were in the U.S., we're not going to be looking

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,140
for the US one on logo.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:03,650
And as far as the return, I just said a simple ending, one with job or whatever is the name of your

15
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,280
application.

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,100
And let's also navigate through the next jazz.

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:16,680
And here what's remove the web vitals and also can remove all of this code.

18
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:22,650
So once we save, eventually we should see here a job of fire.

19
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,570
And we have everything in place now we can move on to a next step.
