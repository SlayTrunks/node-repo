1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,780
Beautiful.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:08,130
And while we're still warming up, let's do another two easy ones first, let's change the title.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:08,980
It's not.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,630
It's going to be the title of your application again.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,340
My Microsoft is going to be job offering.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,470
And second, we also want to replace that little icon right next to the title.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,930
And first, let's start with the title.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,550
And basically, the way we do that, we just navigate to a public folder.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,650
So this sucker over here.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,220
And more specifically in the in the search there, now we're looking for the title tags online as far

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,560
as the favorite on the new one.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,210
The one that I'm going to be using is located in the assets, man, more specifically in the images.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,610
And you're looking for favicon.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,200
I go online.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,970
I'll show you the resource where you can get one for yourself.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,200
So I guess let's start with a title first.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,650
Like I said, we're going to navigate to an exceptional for time being.

18
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:07,960
I'll close the sidebar and then we're basically looking for title tags in the hat element.

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,950
And then instead of React app, I'm just going to type my favorite job offer.

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,310
So I should do it when you want to.

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,340
Like I said, take the favorite favicon from the images.

22
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,650
And in this case, of course, you can copy and paste if you want, but in my case, I'm just going

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,340
to drag and drop.

24
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,570
So you want to get the favor.

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,450
I call from the images into a public one.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,710
That's the goal.

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,310
So let's move there to ask whether we want to replace it, if we do online, the moment we do that.

28
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,610
Now, as we get the favicon as well as the title, actually, we can close the index and the amount.

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,460
We're not going to need it, at least not for now.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,800
And then as far as the resource, if you ever want to get one for yourself, I enjoy using this one,

31
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,760
the favor con eoe.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,320
So once you navigate their.

33
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,690
You don't have these options.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,360
And I guess I'm usually going with a text one online, and here you can provide the text color and you

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,200
can read the rest.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,130
And once you're ready, you can just download online.

37
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,950
You'll get the zip file basically online, you can crack it open and then notice somewhere there is

38
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,980
going to be a favicon icon.

39
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,590
You can add it to your project and you're good to go.

40
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,190
So that should do it for the title on Facebook.com.

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,360
So if you have the same result, now we're going to move on to the next step.
