1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,180
And in order to follow along with the project, you will need some assets like images and CIUSSS, and

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,710
you can get them by visiting the site.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,540
John Smeal dot com ran the URL is Dum Dum Dum Jones.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,890
MiLB.com: And then once you hit this lovely site, keep scrolling and you're looking for the job of

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,430
my project.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,960
Now you might find it in the latest project in the home page.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,970
But if you don't, you'll always find it if you navigate to Project Page and then you can even filter

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,450
it more.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,400
And look just for the man project online once you get the project, the job, if I won this link will

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,690
lead to a lot of application and I'll leave this one open since as will be building some stuff.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,090
I'll show you the final result.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
Just so you have a better understanding.

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,970
And when it comes to staff files and source code, both of them effectively lead back to the same repo,

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,190
the main course job before.

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:09,660
And from this point, you either want to use the clone option where effectively you're out of the URL,

16
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,730
or you can just download the zip.

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,510
So in my case, I'm going to go with a get clone option, so I'll just copy and then navigate back to

18
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,200
my computer.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,960
We're going to go to your city, messed up.

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,750
So first I'm going to navigate the desktop and then I want to go with GIF clone and then pass in the

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,260
URL.

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,770
And once you do that, once you're able to project on your computer, you can continue with the videos.

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,460
And of course, if you're using the download option, I don't need to tell you that the zip file is

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,410
going to be here in the downloads.
