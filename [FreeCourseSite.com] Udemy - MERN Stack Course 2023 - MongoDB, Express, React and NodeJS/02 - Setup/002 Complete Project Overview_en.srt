1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,030
And once the complete project is on your computer.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,850
You can just take a look at it in your text editor.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,980
Now we're not going to spin it up or anything like that, but this is going to be easier if I show you

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,200
that using Visual Studio code.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,980
And essentially, if you want to run the application, you just need to go to read me and then follow

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,550
the steps.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:30,880
So you install dependencies with this command line, you want to rename that and we temp to data entry.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:39,280
And the reason why this is set up this way, so I can give you the examples of the environment variables

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,670
we are looking for, because keep in mind that we do have get a law which will ignore data enemy once

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,130
we push this up to a GitHub.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,150
But what you want to do is rename it to adopt the entry and then you just want to provide your values

12
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,370
for the Mongo you URL.

13
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,880
Basically, this is going to be the connection string to Mongo.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,220
There be revenge than double your secret, as well as JWT Lifetime.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,380
Now to tell you, honestly, you only need to provide this one because if you take a look at the data

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:19,210
and you can say that I already provided some dummy values for JWT Secret as well as JWT Lifetime.

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,330
So the only thing you need to do is just provide connection.

18
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:31,450
String back to your MongoDB database and then you simply want to go with npm start and just answer because

19
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,380
I know I'll get this.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,580
Yes, everything works.

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,810
I checked it multiple times.

22
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,940
Again, you just installed dependencies.

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,280
You just change it to data entry, provide the values and then run npm.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,250
Start here in the root folder and you'll be good to go.

25
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,220
And then the project is going to be on localhost 3000.

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,760
Now, the reason why we actually got the application is not because I want you to spin it up on your

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,450
local machine.

28
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,810
It's actually because if you take a look at the client more specifically source, you'll find this assets

29
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,050
one.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,810
And in here you'll find all this, yes and images.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,200
We're going to use during the project because what you need to understand is that when it comes to these

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,550
bigger projects, I mean, if will build everything from scratch, meaning success as well as get all

33
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,040
the images is you're going to take way longer.

34
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,250
So yes, of course, will type out all the logic when it comes to front end as well as the back and

35
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:32,850
the server.

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,990
But when it comes to a look of the application, basically yes, yes, yes, I provided already all

37
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,720
the resources.

38
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,910
Now you don't need to do anything right now financially in a videos.

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,170
I'll show you where and how I want you to set up this assets folder.

40
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,770
And lastly, one more reason why I wanted you to get the complete project.

41
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:02,790
Because that way, if you ever run into some bugs, you can just simply come here, take a look at my

42
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,070
code and troubleshoot it faster.
