1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,720
Beautiful.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:08,790
And once we have the bare setup in place now, it's enough where we'll place a logo and right next to

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:08,940
it.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,780
There's going to be some going up there with few classes that will add for styling and then in there

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,320
set up hitting one with a name, maybe a little bit of text, as well as button that eventually will

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,060
navigate your way along and register.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,000
Once we set up the reactor or not at the moment.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,030
And then right next, that will place our main image.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,009
So let's go back here.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,940
As far as my main return, I think I'm going to go with main tags and I want to place the logo in the

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,450
nav.

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,520
So let's go here with nav.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,720
So now element.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,000
We're not going to add any classes for now.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,990
We're just going to go with image than for the source.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,320
We want to look for a logo online for alternative.

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,720
Let's just write job five.

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,470
And then we also want to add a glass of logo.

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,670
So let's say here, class name now will be equal to your logo.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,100
Again, there's going to be no styling at the moment since we haven't started using style components,

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,750
but we should say something on a page then right next to it.

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,670
Like I said, there's going to be a there.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,760
We have the main content, so I'm going to create a name for the class of container and page.

24
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,580
Now container comes from the global glasses.

25
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,560
Let's just set up the width.

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,680
Pretty much that I can use in any component.

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:34,070
And there's also going to be a page glass that we use in our style component of an inside of it.

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,690
We have two columns.

29
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,890
Effectively, we have one column where we have all the info.

30
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,070
And in the other column, we're going to have our image, so therefore inside of the container, we'll

31
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,330
start with info first in line for the info we want to go with anyone.

32
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,810
Let's just say job and add a little bit of styling showplace, a Spanish side sidetracking here.

33
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,480
And then right next to it, let's say up.

34
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,940
Let's say that again, there's no styling.

35
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,540
So at the moment it's going to look somewhat ugly.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,090
One i30 think one.

37
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,650
We want to go with paragraph and usually I use.

38
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,580
Hipster ipsum.

39
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,220
So if I go here with hipster.

40
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,490
Ipsum, that's a text that I use, but you can always use just regular lorem as well.

41
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,900
So I go here with whatever paragraphs and then I just pick.

42
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,100
Whichever text I want in this case, I think I'm going to go with this one.

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,130
So inside of this paragraph, I'm just going to set it up.

44
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,130
And then lastly, like I said, there's going to be a link that goes back to a register page.

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,620
But at the moment, we haven't covered React router, so I'll just start simply by creating a button

46
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,330
that will turn this into a link.

47
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,210
And here we have two classes.

48
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,160
We have the global median class.

49
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,570
And we also have between hero and as far as the name, let's just say logging.

50
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,850
And register.

51
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:07,760
So once we set this one up, only thing that's missing here is side by side with this there with this

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,180
info.

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,080
And you know what?

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,100
Let me add a comment here.

55
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,820
Let me say here info and not right next to it or place our image because again, there's going to be

56
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,100
a two column layout on the big screen.

57
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:25,700
And in fact, on a small screen, if you looked at the job before I went on the phone, you noticed

58
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,200
that there's actually no image.

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,110
So this image we're actually displaying only once we get to the big screen.

60
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,150
So right next to our info, Dave, we want to go here with second image and here we on display main.

61
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,730
And as far as the alternative, I'm going to go on job hunt.

62
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,340
And let's add some classes here as well.

63
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,780
Let's just say I am.

64
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,250
So this is pretty much a global image class that I'm using.

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,810
And then I also want to add main image because again, it will will be showing and hiding this particular

66
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,430
image on different screens.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,860
And once we are done with the basic set up and once we have our sample return.

68
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,700
Now let's talk about the styling that we're going to use throughout the project.
