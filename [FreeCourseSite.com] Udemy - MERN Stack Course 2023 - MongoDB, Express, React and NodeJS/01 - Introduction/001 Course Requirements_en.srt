00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,830
All right, and welcome to the course.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:08,790
And before we continue, let's address the elephant in the room the course requirements, since this

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,170
is an advanced course.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:19,650
My expectation is that you are already familiar with React and A.j.'s fundamentals since, in my opinion,

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:27,600
when it comes to learn, it's really about combining our existing frontend and server knowledge instead

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,670
of starting everything from the blank page.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,500
So in other words, this is not a course where we'll cover React or Node.js just from scratch.

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,030
Simply because it would take way too long.

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:47,850
And it would be very unfair to the people who are already familiar with both technologies.

10
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:56,560
As far as the react, like I already mentioned, I'm assuming that you already know the fundamentals.

11
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,110
For example, water is a component.

12
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,800
And on top of that, you are familiar with react hooks.

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,590
Know how to implement the most used ones.

14
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,690
So think you state?

15
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:17,390
Use the fact use reducer and use context, and also, you know, how to create global context in your

16
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,500
React application.

17
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:26,030
When it comes to server, I'm assuming that you can set up a basic server, create controllers and or

18
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,210
else have a MongoDB Atlas account.

19
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,830
Know how to connect to it.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,240
And lastly, have some experience with JSON web tokens.

21
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:44,290
Now, if you do need a refresher on any of these topics, I do have tons and tons of free videos where

22
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:51,370
I cover all of those things from scratch and showcase all of the steps and gotchas in great detail.

23
00:01:51,970 --> 00:02:00,460
So please do not skip the following lecture and if necessary, please utilize any or all of the free

24
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,170
resources I provided.
