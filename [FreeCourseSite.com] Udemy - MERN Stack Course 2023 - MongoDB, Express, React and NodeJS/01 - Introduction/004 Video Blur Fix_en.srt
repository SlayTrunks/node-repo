1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,860
We're watching the course you might experience these two following issues of the video quality goes

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,340
bananas.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,320
And the transcript does not match exactly to what I'm saying in the video.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,230
Please be aware that both of these issues have nothing to do with specific course or how it was recorded.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,050
Meaning you might experience the same issues in different courses as well, and in general, instructors

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,210
have no control over such things.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,690
So the first issue you might encounter could be a bad video quality where as you're watching, the video

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,290
screen turns blurry and it's very hard to read anything off the screen, and I'll spare you the long

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,010
explanation.

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,340
Essentially, the issue is caused by auto resolution.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,160
Lucky for us, though, the fix is very simple.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,050
Just click on the Settings Cog and choose 720.

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,450
Now, if your internet connection is slow, you might need to go for even lower resolution.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,930
But for the most part, 720p will do the job.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,550
So imagine you're watching the course, and all of a sudden video quality gets bad.

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:12,720
Just locate the settings cog and manually select 720p, even if you have a different value set as auto.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,470
And the second issue you might experience is video transcript.

18
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,950
Being off meaning if you prefer using subtitles or you just want to read the transcript, text might

19
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,490
not match exactly to what I'm saying in the video again.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,190
Instructors have no control over that, and unfortunately, at this point in time, I cannot provide

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,670
you with any possible fix for this particular issue.
